Introduction

I've (re)architected and contributed features to several production Go services at Codecademy.

- Rearchitected our docs-service
- Architected a new ugc-articles-service
- Implemented a payment provider agnostic coupon functionality to our payments service

Rearchitected Docs Service

#back-text
Our docs-service transforms the markdown files in Codecademy's [docs github repo](https://github.com/codecademy/docs) into a queryable data source which powers the docs resources [on our site](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs).

The original service had been complex, and involved regexing and parsing raw repo files at request time.

I led a full redesign to leverage pre-parsed data tree structures, improving both readability and performance.

UGC-Articles Service

#front-text
Codecademy wanted to try a similar "user generated content" model for Codecademy articles (like we already did for docs).

I architected and tech led the implementation of a new backend go service to enable this feature.

Similar to the docs service, it pulled raw data from a [github repo](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc) combined with user profile data from our site's main backend service and exposed it on a graphQL API for our FE to consume.

Provider-Agnostic Coupon Functionality

#back-text
We've had multiple payment vendors ([Recurly](https://recurly.com/), [PayTM](https://paytm.com/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)), each of which handles coupon discounts differently.

I augmented our Go "payments and billing service" to support provider-agnostic coupon functionality that abstracts away vendor-specific API implementation and allows us to more easily create, validate and apply a given coupon code at checkout.
