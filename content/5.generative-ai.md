Introduction

#front-text
At Codecademy we wanted to use gen AI to attract new users and keep current, so I worked on a couple projects to help us do that.

These included a ChatGPT plugin (later a 'GPT') and our catalog assistant chatbot.

ChatGPT Plugin

#back-text
The [ChatGPT plugin store](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plugins/) was launched in March of 2023. This allowed developers to create and share 'plugins' to augment the abilities of ChatGPT.

I tech led the development of Codecademy's plugin, which went live in August of 2023.

Plugin Capabilities

#front-text
The plugin gave ChatGPT knowledge of Codecademy resources like our:

- [Course catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog)
- [Articles](https://www.codecademy.com/articles)
- [Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs)

Tracking and Feedback

#back-image

#back-text
The plugin store did not offer analytics, so we rolled our own.

All links to Codecademy resources were tagged with UTM parameters & calls to our plugin API were logged to track user engagement.

We also tweaked our plugin response so ChatGPT would include a survey link any time it requested our data.

Migraton to GPT

#front-text
On January 10th of 2024, [OpenAI opened the new GPT store](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-gpt-store/) as a successor to plugins.

I quickly migrated our plugin to a GPT and we were live on the GPT store the very next day on January 11th.

Catalog Assistant

#back-text
I also contributed to our catalog assistant chatbot, which my team had first launched in June of 2024.

This assistant appears on our [course catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog) and has knowledge of all our courses.

Suggested Prompts

![suggested prompts](/images/generative-ai/suggested_prompts.png)

#front-text
I worked on adding suggested prompts to appear on our catalog hub pages like the [Python hub](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python).

These prompts are generated programmatically based on the context of the hub (whether a language or a subject).

Clicking on one opens up the chat window and feeds the prompt to the AI chatbot.

#back-title
Surfacing Relevant Projects

#back-image

#back-text
I also set up a data pipeline to feed project info as embeddings to the vectorDB which powers our RAG setup with [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain).

This allows the assistant to suggest relevant projects we offer at Codecademy (and not just full courses).
