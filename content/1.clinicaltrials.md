Introduction

![search params](/images/clinicaltrials/search_params.png)

#front-text
Our lab needed a fast, easy way to provide our patients with relevant clinical trials on their reports.

I built a system from the ground up that saved our lab $700 a month since we no longer need to pay a 3rd party for a similar service.

Automated Email Reports

#back-text
Every morning the system automatically scans [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) for new trials to add or existing ones to modify in our database.

A summary report is then generated and emailed to us.

Keyword Mappings

#front-image
![keyword manager UI](/images/clinicaltrials/oncotree_keyword_manager.png)

#front-text
The core text mining algorithm relies on keywords to determine which type(s) of cancer a trial is targeting.

An Oncotree Keywords Manager UI makes it easy to add/modify keyword associations for all [oncotree lv1](http://oncotree.mskcc.org/#/home) tissue types.

Emedded Search Widget

![trial results](/images/clinicaltrials/trial_results.png)

#back-text
Each patient's case page has a trials widget. Their age, sample tissue type, and genetic alterations are autopopulated as search params.

Results are sorted according to popularity in our system and local availability if patient is from UPMC.

Single-Click Inclusion

#front-image
![search NCT](/images/clinicaltrials/search_NCT.png)

#front-text
Qualified users simply click a checkbox to include a trial on a patient's final report.

Orange genes signify relevancy to the patient. At least one will be orange, but multiple can be specified if appropriate.

Seamless Report Integration

#back-image
![trials on a report](/images/clinicaltrials/trials_on_report.png)

#back-text
Selected trials are listed on a patient's final report.

If both the patient and the trial are local, the **_\*Available in Pittsburgh_** text appears next to that trial and it gets sorted to the top of the list.
