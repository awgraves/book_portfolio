#front-text
I've fostered Codecademy's tech community both internally and externally by:

- Leading an engineering book club
- Co-organizing a dev workshop
- Producing a video for Codecademy's Youtube channel

Engineering Book Club

#back-text
I have been leading a bi-weekly engineering book club at Codecademy since October 2023.

The most recent book that won our book election process was ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

This book is very long but we're nearly finished with it now in April of 2025. You can see the related bytecode interpreter code I wrote [here](https://github.com/awgraves/clox).

Golang Dev Workshop

#front-text
Many of the engineers at Codecademy were interested in learning Golang, so I co-organized a hands-on workshop to teach them.

I collaborated with a colleague to create original, cumulative exercises that resulted in a working web server. See [the repo](https://github.com/codecademy-engineering/intermediate-go-training-2023/tree/main) for yourself!

We had a great turnout of 15+ engineers for a 2 hour workshop.

Codecademy Youtube Video

#back-text
Our marketing team asked me to produce a [walk-through coding video](https://youtu.be/4AFjKHQNiUM?si=LVe9t9a7gMaSg70m) to help give learners insight into how software engineers approach coding problems.

I crafted my own unique version of an existing Codecademy project in order to showcase more realistic coding practices in my solution.
