Introduction

#front-text
Email just wasn't cutting it. We needed a better way to communicate and track technical issues.

I designed an in-house ticketing system with speed and efficiency in mind. It is directly integrated inside our main application.

#back-title
Easily Accessible

#back-image
![auto detecting current page](/images/helpdesk/autodetect_current_page.png)

#back-text
The 'Get Help' button is always available in the bottom left of our application.

If a user clicks to open a new ticket while viewing a case page, info about this page can be auto-included so they won't have to type it.

Streamlined Submission Process

#front-text
'Speed dial' options and targeted prompts have worked well.

Users can enter tickets in a few clicks, and we on the BI team are sure to receive the details we need.

#back-title
Live Monitoring

#back-image
![follow a ticket](/images/helpdesk/follow_a_ticket.png)

#back-text
Each ticket shows the current status and who on the BI team is working on it. Users can monitor other tickets they find in addition to their own.

Active tickets display at the top of any associated case pages. A user need only click a button to begin monitoring it.

Admin Process

#front-image
![completing a ticket](/images/helpdesk/completing_a_ticket.png)

#front-text
A new ticket triggers a batch email to all BI team members with details and a link to the Help Desk admin dashboard.

A team member assigns it to themselves, then marks it as 'completed' once finished.

#back-title
In-App Notifications

#back-image
![user confirms ticket resolution](/images/helpdesk/user_confirms_ticket_resolution.png)

#back-text
A 'completed' ticket triggers the Help Desk window to open on the initiator of the ticket.

Confirming the ticket closes it and alerts all who are monitoring. Declining provides an optional textbox to explain, then kicks the ticket back to the BI team.

Admin Stats

#front-text
It's useful to track the frequency and types of issues we get over time.

Line and bar charts can visualize data from the previous 7 days up to 1 year. Clicking on a bar from the bar chart will provide more details (see next page).

#back-title
Detailed Records

More granular data about our tickets are available by category.

The table has sortable columns and a search bar to filter for specific keywords.
