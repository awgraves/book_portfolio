Introduction

#front-text
Why use paper to record case QAs when we can make them electronic and fully integrated?

Our pathologists consult one another on difficult cases. My system lets them record, search, and export their feedback from within our application.

#back-title
Available Directly on Case Pages

#back-image
![signout qa dropdown](/images/signoutqas/signout_qa_dropdown.png)

#back-text
Pathologists and fellows in our lab have a 'Signout QA' button available at the top of each case.

Users simply click to start recording feedback about the case they are on.

Entering a QA

#front-text
Reviewers can be a single person or the 'Consensus' group of pathologists who meet every week to discuss cases together.

The reviewer(s) also have the ability to mark a case as 'interesting' by clicking the star (more on this later).

#back-title
Viewing a QA

#back-image
![view existing on case](/images/signoutqas/view_existing_on_case.png)

#back-text
Viewing a QA is as easy as entering one. They can be accessed via the same button menu at the top of the page.

QA details also specify whether the QA happened before or after the final report was signed out and sent to the physician.

All QAs Together

#front-text
QAs not only appear on each individual case but also collectively in a centralized 'QA Manager'. Clicking a case from the list will open it in a new tab.

Users can alse enter special additional QAs on cases not in our system (from other tests/labs).

#back-title
'Interesting' Cases

#back-image
![only interesting qas](/images/signoutqas/only_interesting_QAs_cropped.png)

#back-text
Sometimes the pathologists bookmark special cases to bring up for future discussion.

Clicking the star at the top next to the date range will filter for these.

Refined Searches

![filtered to MET](/images/signoutqas/filtered_MET.png)

#front-text
Results can be refined even further with the searchbar in the top right.

In this example, we can see the bookmarked cases within our date range that discussed the MET gene.

#back-title
Exporting

#back-image
![export options](/images/signoutqas/export_options.png)

#back-text
Pathologists sometimes desire a printed out list of cases to reference, and lab management sometimes wants to have QA data for internal reporting.

Whatever the scenario, users can easily download the data as a CSV file.
