#front-text
Our lab had no way to search our full ThyroSeq\* case archive for specific genetic or demographic criteria; at least until now!

\*[ThyroSeq](https://thyroseq.com) is our lab's flagship product and a thyroid cancer test utilizing Next Generation Sequencing.

There are 48 total queriable fields & subfields that can be combined however the user wants.

To keep the UI clean, query filters are grouped under general category boxes that expand/collapse.

![opened variants](/images/geneticsearch/opened_variants.png)

#front-text
Each type of genetic alteration can have multiple entries, such as multiple variants the user wants to be present in the resulting cases.

Users describe each alteration using 1 or more subfields then click to add that alteration to the main query list.

The query panel collapses once the server sends back the search results.

Icons on the left indicate which types and how many filters are active.

Hovering over these icons shows full details for each group.

![reopened params](/images/geneticsearch/reopened_params.png)

#front-text
The query panel can expand out again for the user to add, modify, or remove search criteria.

There is also a reset button to easily clear all inputs and start fresh.

#back-title
Export

#back-image
![export reports](/images/geneticsearch/export_reports.png)

#back-text
Full data for resulting cases can be exported to Excel. This data includes more info about the case than the results table preview shows.

Larger exports (greater than 20 cases) take longer to compile, so a download link is sent to the user once the file is prepared.
